## Lessons Learned

One possible implementation to enhance the user experience of a music player website/application is to dynamically change the body background based on the selected song. In this approach, the most dominant color from the song's cover photo is extracted and applied as a linear-gradient to the body background.

When ever the tab or navigation changes then song should remains playing.
